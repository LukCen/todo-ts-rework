# Another To-do app, improved and reworked! 
Based on a challenge from [https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW]

This version will be made with TypeScript and will include OOP as well as a cleaner look and more features. 


The complete roadmap is as follows :

 
- [X] User can create new tasks by interacting with the app
- [X] User can mark tasks as complete and delete individual tasks
- [ ] User can delete all tasks marked complete  
- [-] User can switch into light/dark mode on demand, with color pallete adjusting dynamically (partially implemented)
- [ ] The app should provide a counter for how many tasks are currently displayed, updated dynamically
- [ ] The app should adjust to a mobile screen, remaining easily readable and accessible
